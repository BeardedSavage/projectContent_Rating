                    <p className="about-or">Outer-Rim is a group of Millenials who met on a DayZ community server. Once that community fell apart, they decided to rebuld that community <br />
                    on their own. 1.0 was a mess and a headache trying to chase bugs and problems on a constant. 1.25 was a test to see if something different would <br />
                work. We tried a map called Prypiat and it was a tragic failure as it caused conflict, and that, in turn, caused team members to seperate. <br />
                With a deep understanding behind the coding adn a new knowledge and perception 1.5 came along. 1.5 was a beefed up version of 1.0. <br />
                Then here we are today with 2.0. It is a 1.5 version with all the fixes neccesary to the 1.25 DayZ update. These trials and tests <br />
                could not have been done with out the Develpment team and Administrastor hard and fully dedicated work and partnership to bring you <br />
